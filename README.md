# Unsupervised_Learning_PCA_KMeans_DBSCAN
This repository demonstrates unsupervised learning with PCA for dimensionality reduction, K-means for clustering, and DBSCAN for density-based clustering. It explores how PCA enhances data visualization and compares the performance of K-means and DBSCAN in clustering real-world datasets.
